	<h1>A case about parsing errors</h1>
	<p>
		So this is my first blog post, and I would like to start making a point about parsing errors, as this weekend I was refactoring the error handling architecture in <a href=https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264>edge264</a>, a software decoder for the video codec <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC>H.264/AVC</a>.
	<p>
		Decoding a multimedia stream is a lot of parsing (easily half of the codebase).
		You receive a bitstream from which you extract a sequence of values, compressed using e.g. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential-Golomb_coding>Exp-Golomb</a> or <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding>Arithmetic coding</a>.
		These will form a header first, then the actual data, which after a few more stages in decompression yield pixels. But what happens if the bitstream contains an error?
	
	<h2>Know your enemy</h2>
	<p>To my best guess, there are three kinds of errors to expect:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>transmission errors</i>.
			A stream such as digital TV can come through satellite, Internet, Radio Frequency or even hard drive.
			No transmission being perfect, chunks can be missed, inserted, reordered, corrupted â€” hopefully not too often.
			Basically <i>anything can happen</i>.
		<li>
			<i>forged stream</i>.
			This can be a malicious user trying to crash your software by sending unexpected data, or just someone developing an encoder who mistakenly inserted a bug.
			Though the peskiest, this is arguably the least expectable case of errors, since writing an encoder (even a flawed one) is not a morning breakfast.
		<li>
			<i>unsupported features</i>.
			These happen, major codecs such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding#Profiles>HEVC</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding#Extensions_and_improvements>AAC</a> contain a <i>lot</i> of optional features and extensions, many of which are seldom used.
			These typically increase the architectural complexity of decoders, thus not all are supported.
	</ul>
	<p>
		In practice, software such as ffmpeg dedicate a decent amount of <a href=https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/libavcodec/h264_ps.c>code</a> (search for <code>AV_LOG_ERROR</code>) and <a href=https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/trunk/group__lavu__error.html>documentation</a> to error handling, that is providing an alternate code path in case of erroneous input, and keeping a defined behaviour afterwards.
		However, they rarely provide a clear strategy for <b>error reporting</b>, that is what should be presented to the end user when something is wrong, and which errors do trigger this behaviour.
	<p>
		The common default choice is to provide an error code for every wrong input one can think of, and optionally print out an error message when it is caught.
		It then becomes of programmerâ€™s responsibility to handle all of them, no matter how frequent they might be in practical streams.
		In software such as VLC, these messages are eventually forwarded to the user through an Error Console.
	<p>
		However, in the context of a multimedia stream, users have no power to fix an incoming bitstream by hand, should any of the above errors actually happen.
		Their sole ability is probably to move the antenna and catch a clearer signal â€” if and only if they have access to it.
		For these users, rendering a black frame is probably just as good as printing <code>[h264 @ 0xba7bc00] illegal bit depth value (28, 8)</code>.
	<p>
		Moreover, transport protocols and containers provide mechanisms for detecting errors and possibly recover them.
		The TCP network protocol reorders incoming packets, and can request resending a missing one.
		The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG_transport_stream#Packet>MPEG2-TS</a> multimedia container signals corrupted packets, and is augmented with error detection/correction for digital TV broadcasting.
		Thus in practice most glitches are detected upstream, such that very few bitstream errors practically make it to the audio/video decoders.
	
	<h2>Single out the uses</h2>
	<p>Letâ€™s proceed by identifying the few uses of a multimedia library, before trying to derive a good error reporting strategy:
	<ul>
		<li>
			playing a video (duh!).
			As mentioned above, error messages can be minimal here, users are not supposed to have read the 732-pages spec you went through, neither be familiar with such notions as bit depth or color planes (they donâ€™t fly).
		<li>
			developing a parent library (ffmpeg) or a multimedia player (VLC).
			In this case a decoding error is most likely linked to a bug in either library, thus extensive error reporting helps hunting it.
		<li>
			developing an encoder for the same format.
			Here the multimedia library is used to validate candidate streams.
			Any erroneous value that is silently ignored or clamped to a valid one can result in the shipping of a flawed encoder.
			As it is then used to compress flawed streams (which still exist after patching the encoder), later decoders have to cope with these special cases.
	</ul>
	<p>
		With these in mind, we can see the problem with competing open source H.264 decoders (for <a href=https://github.com/cisco/openh264/blob/master/codec/decoder/core/src/au_parser.cpp>Cisco OpenH264</a>, search for <code>WELS_LOG</code>): they try to match a bit of all uses, without being a perfect fit for any of the three.
		There are just too many errors a user cannot understand, yet not all irregular inputs are reported.
	<p>
		To settle this I want to make a distinction between a <b>validator</b> and a <b>parser</b>.
		The validator takes a possibly erroneous input stream and reports everything wrong, without actually decoding it.
		Its output is meant to help fixing the encoding library, or the stream itself, and its goal is to guarantee any accepted stream will comply with the target specification.
		The parser in turn takes a possibly erroneous stream, but only bothers decoding it for end users.
		Error reporting is minimal, if not present at all, but the parser should try to recover gracefully from a bad stream because no user will want to fix it.
	<p>
		In edge264 I decided to focus on <a href=https://github.com/tvlabs/edge264/blob/master/edge264.c>parsing</a> (search for <code>e->ret</code>) and completely avoid validation, it being a very difficult problem in fact!
		All input values are silently clamped to the bounds specified in H.264, such that one can always expect a correct internal state.
		The few mandatory tests for unsupported features are collapsed into common exit branches (5 in total).
		Also in earlier versions I had no error reporting at all, but that could result in a video player not knowing when to stop trying to decode a flawed stream.
		Hence the presence of two error codes (for unsupported and erroneous stream).
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		Ruling out validation from parsing (or explicitly going for both) helps making a clear commitment to which errors are tested, and which are ignored.
		In the case of edge264 it helped me focus on the rest of the decoding, and put less constraints on code structure (function return values, trace output, no pesky <code>goto fail</code> branches).
		Further usage will show how it fares in practice, and whether more errors should eventually be reported.
		As for the actual details of a <i>simple</i> code architecture, these are left for later articles ðŸ™‚
	<p>
		Also, for coherency in this post I remained in the scope of video decoding, but am pretty much convinced the separation of validation and parsing should also exist in other domains, especially with man-made streams, such as code compilation and <a href=https://validator.w3.org/>HTML parsing</a>.
